## Code of Conduct - Coding
### Python
* Avoid using too many words when naming something
* Use CamelCase to name variables skateBoard etc.
* Comments should be explanatory and clear
* Comments should be before functions
* When indenting use spaces instead of tabs
* Avoid extraneous spaces i.e. after a comma in between parenthesis
* Package names should always be lower case
* Comments and names should be in English, avoid native language
* Capitalize all abbreviations
* Format code properly and frequently
## Dart
* Final variables uppercase and underscore
* CamelCase
* Prefer local over global variables
* Class names start with uppercase, capitalize first letter of new word
* Typedef start with uppercase, capitalize first letter of new word
* Argument identifiers start lowercase
* Function names start lowercase, capitalize first letter of new word
* Package names lowercase
### Comments:
* Comment in english
* End sentences with a dot
* Write complete sentences and leave breadcrumbs when possible
## Javascript
### Basic stuff:
* Variables 
* Camel Cases
* const should be used by default. If you really need to use let, its acceptable.
* Must not use var
### Functions
* Arrow function
* Simple and understandable functions name
* function parameters must not be named ‘arguments’
### Properties
* Dot/subscript notation must be used consistently.
* Dot notation should be used when possible
### Operators

* Non-strict comparison operators == or != must not be used. Strict comparison operators === or !== must be used instead.
### Comments
* /* ... */-style must be used for non-jsdoc multiline comments.
* /** ... */-style must be used for jsdoc comments.
* // For single-line comments, comment on the previous line of whatever you're commenting.
* Only in English

### Whitespace
* Soft-spacing 2-characters must be used. NOT TABS
* 1 space must be used before the leading brace {.
### Classes
* Class names must be PascalCase
* Full Code convention of Javascript
* ES6 https://github.com/elierotenberg/coding-styles/blob/master/es6.md
